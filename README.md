# AGI Agent 🤖

A general-purpose Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) agent capable of completing complex tasks and inventing solutions through advanced reasoning, planning, and tool integration.

## 🌟 Features

- **Advanced Reasoning Engine**: Multi-type reasoning (analytical, creative, logical, causal, strategic)
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatic decomposition of complex tasks into executable steps
- **Tool Integration Framework**: Seamless integration with external tools and APIs
- **Knowledge Management**: Persistent knowledge storage and retrieval
- **Learning System**: Continuous improvement through experience
- **Safety Controls**: Built-in safety mechanisms and human oversight
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible and maintainable design

## 🏗️ Architecture

The AGI Agent is built with a modular architecture consisting of:

1. **Reasoning Engine** - Core decision-making and problem-solving
2. **Task Planner** - Breaks down complex tasks into executable steps
3. **Knowledge Manager** - Stores and retrieves information
4. **Tool Integration** - Interfaces with external tools and services
5. **Learning System** - Improves performance through experience
6. **Safety Controller** - Ensures safe operation
7. **Communication Interface** - Handles user interaction

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key or Anthropic API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agi-agent.git
cd agi-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

4. Run the example:
```bash
python example.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from agi_agent import AGIAgent, AgentConfig

async def main():
    # Configure the agent
    config = AgentConfig(
        model_provider="openai",
        model_name="gpt-4",
        safety_level="high"
    )
    
    # Initialize the agent
    agent = AGIAgent(config)
    
    # Process a request
    response = await agent.process_request(
        "Create a Python script that analyzes data trends"
    )
    
    if response.success:
        print("Task completed successfully!")
        print(f"Result: {response.result}")
    else:
        print(f"Task failed: {response.error}")
    
    await agent.shutdown()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Core Components

#### Reasoning Engine
The reasoning engine provides various types of reasoning capabilities:

- **Analytical**: Step-by-step problem analysis
- **Creative**: Novel solution generation
- **Strategic**: Goal-oriented planning
- **Causal**: Cause-and-effect analysis
- **Logical**: Formal reasoning processes

#### Task Planning
The task planner automatically:

- Decomposes complex tasks into manageable steps
- Identifies dependencies between steps
- Estimates execution time
- Optimizes execution order
- Handles error recovery

#### Safety System
Built-in safety mechanisms include:

- Action approval workflows
- Risk assessment
- Constraint enforcement
- Human oversight integration
- Rollback capabilities

### Configuration

The agent can be configured through the `AgentConfig` class:

```python
config = AgentConfig(
    model_provider="openai",      # "openai" or "anthropic"
    model_name="gpt-4",           # Model to use
    max_reasoning_depth=10,       # Maximum reasoning steps
    safety_level="high",          # "low", "medium", "high"
    learning_enabled=True,        # Enable learning system
    auto_approve_safe_actions=False  # Auto-approve safe actions
)
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# OR
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

# Optional
AGI_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
AGI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
AGI_SAFETY_LEVEL=high
AGI_LEARNING_ENABLED=true
```
