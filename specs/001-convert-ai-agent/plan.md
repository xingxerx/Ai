# Implementation Plan: AI Agent Rust Conversion

**Branch**: `001-convert-ai-agent` | **Date**: December 17, 2024 | **Spec**: [specs/001-convert-ai-agent/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-convert-ai-agent/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Convert AI agent performance-critical components to Rust while maintaining Python for ML/AI functionality. Create PyO3 bindings for seamless interop. Focus on CLI interface (<100ms startup), file processing (5-10x performance), tool execution, and system integration in Rust. Maintain identical AI capabilities and backward compatibility.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+ (performance layer) + Python 3.11+ (ML/AI layer)  
**Primary Dependencies**: PyO3 0.19+ (Python bindings), Clap 4.0 (CLI), Tokio 1.0 (async), Tracing (observability)  
**Storage**: Maintain existing SQLite for agent memory, JSON for configurations  
**Testing**: Cargo test (Rust), pytest (Python), integration tests across language boundaries  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Hybrid system - performance-critical Rust layer + AI/ML Python layer  
**Performance Goals**: CLI startup <100ms, file operations 5-10x faster, concurrent tool execution  
**Constraints**: Maintain backward compatibility, identical ML capabilities, seamless data exchange  
**Scale/Scope**: Existing AI agent codebase (~10k LOC Python), add ~5k LOC Rust

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Performance-First Principle**: ✅ PASS - Rust conversion aligns with performance optimization goals
**Backward Compatibility**: ✅ PASS - Design maintains existing API contracts and AI capabilities  
**Testing Requirements**: ✅ PASS - Plan includes comprehensive testing across language boundaries
**Simplicity**: ⚠️ COMPLEXITY JUSTIFIED - Hybrid language architecture adds complexity but necessary for performance gains while preserving ML ecosystem
**Observability**: ✅ PASS - Tracing and monitoring planned for both Rust and Python components

**Structure Decision**: Hybrid architecture with Rust for performance-critical components and Python for AI/ML functionality

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - PyO3 best practices for large data exchange patterns
   - Async communication patterns between Rust-Python components
   - Memory management strategies for cross-language boundaries
   - Error handling patterns for hybrid systems

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   Task: "Research PyO3 best practices for data exchange and async operations"
   Task: "Find performance benchmarking approaches for Rust-Python bridges"  
   Task: "Research Rust async patterns with Tokio for CLI applications"
   Task: "Investigate cross-platform build strategies for hybrid projects"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Agent Core: Orchestration state, command routing, performance metrics
   - Tool Executor: Tool registry, execution context, result handling
   - File Processor: File operations, transformation pipelines, streaming interfaces
   - CLI Interface: Command definitions, argument parsing, output formatting
   - Python Bridge: Data serialization, async channels, error mapping
   - Configuration Manager: Settings schema, validation rules, migration paths
   - Performance Monitor: Metrics collection, profiling data, threshold alerts

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Rust CLI commands → Python agent functions
   - Python ML results → Rust response handling
   - File processing operations → streaming interfaces
   - Tool execution protocols → async result channels
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - PyO3 binding tests for each interface
   - CLI command integration tests
   - File processing performance tests
   - Cross-language error handling tests
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - CLI startup performance scenarios
   - File processing benchmark scenarios
   - Concurrent tool execution scenarios
   - ML capability preservation scenarios
   - Cross-platform deployment scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot` for GitHub Copilot
   - Add Rust-Python hybrid architecture context
   - Update with PyO3, Tokio, performance requirements
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each PyO3 binding → contract test task [P]
- Each Rust component → module creation task [P]
- Each integration point → cross-language test task
- Performance benchmarking tasks to validate 5-10x improvements
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Rust modules before Python bridges before integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent components)
- Performance validation tasks after core implementation

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Hybrid Language Architecture | Performance requirements demand 5-10x speed improvement + preserve ML ecosystem | Pure Rust: Would require reimplementing entire ML stack. Pure Python: Cannot achieve performance targets |
| PyO3 Bindings Layer | Seamless data exchange between Rust performance layer and Python AI components | API/IPC: Too slow for performance targets. FFI: Unsafe and complex error handling |
