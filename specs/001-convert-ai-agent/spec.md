# Feature Specification: AI Agent Rust Conversion

**Feature Branch**: `001-convert-ai-agent`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Convert AI agent components to Rust for performance while keeping ML/AI parts in Python. Focus on CLI, tool execution, file processing, and system integration in Rust."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the AI agent system, I want the agent to execute tasks faster and more reliably while maintaining the same AI/ML capabilities, so that I can complete complex workflows efficiently without performance bottlenecks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI agent task requiring file processing, **When** the agent executes the task, **Then** the file operations complete 5-10x faster than the current Python implementation
2. **Given** a CLI command for the AI agent, **When** the command is invoked, **Then** the startup time is under 100ms and response time is under 200ms
3. **Given** multiple concurrent agent operations, **When** system resources are limited, **Then** the agent handles concurrent operations without memory leaks or crashes
4. **Given** an AI model inference request, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the ML/AI functionality remains identical to the current Python implementation
5. **Given** tool execution requests, **When** the agent executes external tools, **Then** tool execution is faster and more robust with better error handling

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Rust components fail to communicate with Python ML components?
- How does the system handle memory management across Rust-Python boundaries?
- What occurs when large datasets need to be passed between Rust and Python components?
- How does error handling work across language boundaries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain identical AI/ML inference capabilities after conversion
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide CLI interface with sub-100ms startup time
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute file processing operations 5-10x faster than current implementation
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle concurrent tool execution without resource conflicts
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide seamless data exchange between Rust and Python components
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing agent configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide robust error handling across language boundaries
- **FR-008**: System MUST support all current tool integrations (file operations, web requests, system commands)
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain existing agent memory and learning capabilities
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide performance monitoring and profiling capabilities
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle system integration tasks (process management, environment variables, path operations) more efficiently
- **FR-012**: System MUST support cross-platform deployment (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Agent Core**: Central orchestrator that coordinates between Rust performance layer and Python AI layer
- **Tool Executor**: Rust-based component responsible for executing external tools and system operations
- **File Processor**: High-performance file handling component for reading, writing, and transforming files
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface providing fast access to agent capabilities
- **Python Bridge**: Interface layer enabling seamless communication between Rust and Python components
- **Configuration Manager**: System for managing agent settings, model configurations, and runtime parameters
- **Performance Monitor**: Component for tracking execution metrics and system resource usage
