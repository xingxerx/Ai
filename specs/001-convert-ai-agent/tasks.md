# Tasks: AI Agent Rust Conversion

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-convert-ai-agent/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md (pending), contracts/ (pending)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extracted: Rust 1.75+, PyO3 0.19+, Tokio, hybrid architecture
2. Load optional design documents:
   → research.md ✅: PyO3 patterns, async strategies, build approaches
   → data-model.md: (to be created)
   → contracts/: (to be created)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Rust workspace, Python integration, dependencies
   → Tests: PyO3 bridge tests, performance benchmarks, integration tests
   → Core: Rust modules, Python bindings, CLI implementation
   → Integration: Cross-language communication, error handling
   → Polish: performance validation, documentation, deployment
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files/modules = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Hybrid architecture**: `src/` (Rust), `agi_agent/` (Python), `tests/` (both)
- Rust modules in `src/`, Python in existing `agi_agent/`
- PyO3 bindings bridge the two worlds

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Infrastructure

- [ ] T001 Configure Cargo workspace in `Cargo.toml` with multiple crates

## Phase 3.3: Core Rust Components (ONLY after tests are failing)

- [ ] T016 [P] File processor module in `src/file_processor/mod.rs`

## Phase 3.4: Python Bridge Implementation

- [ ] T028 [P] Python bridge module in `src/python_bridge/mod.rs`

- [ ] T052 Final integration testing with existing Python codebase

## Dependencies

- **Setup phase** (T001-T007) must complete first
- **Tests** (T008-T015) before any implementation
- **Rust core** (T016-T027) can run in parallel after tests
- **Python bridge** (T028-T035) depends on Rust core completion
- **Integration** (T036-T042) requires both Rust and Python components
- **Validation** (T043-T052) requires complete implementation

## Parallel Execution Examples

```bash
# Phase 3.2: Parallel test creation
Task: "PyO3 bridge contract test in tests/cross_language/test_bridge.py"
Task: "File processing performance test in tests/rust/test_file_processor.rs"
Task: "CLI startup performance test in tests/rust/test_cli_performance.rs"

Task: "File processor module in src/file_processor/mod.rs"
Task: "Tool executor module in src/tools/mod.rs"
Task: "System integration module in src/system/mod.rs"

- **CLI Startup**: <100ms (current: unknown, test with T010)
- **File Processing**: 5-10x faster than Python (benchmark with T009)
- **Tool Execution**: Improved concurrency and error handling
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient cross-language memory management
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All cross-language interfaces tested
- [ ] Performance targets validated
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive

## Notes

- [P] tasks target different files/modules with no dependencies
- TDD approach: tests fail first, then implement to make them pass
- Maintain existing Python ML functionality throughout
- PyO3 bridge ensures seamless integration
- Focus on performance-critical paths first
- Continuous benchmarking against Python baseline
