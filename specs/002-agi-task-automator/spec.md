# Feature Specification: AGI Task Automator

**Feature Branch**: `002-agi-task-automator`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AGI Task Automator - Natural language task automation agent that safely executes local system tasks with user approval. Features: NL input parsing, real-time user consent, local-only execution, cross-platform support, audit logging, and extensible script system."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: AGI Task Automator with NL parsing, user consent, local execution
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users, Developers, System Agent
   ‚Üí Actions: Parse NL, Execute tasks, Request approval, Log actions
   ‚Üí Data: Task descriptions, execution logs, user preferences
   ‚Üí Constraints: Local-only, user approval required, cross-platform
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All core concepts are clear from description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenarios: Task input ‚Üí approval ‚Üí execution ‚Üí logging
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 12 testable requirements covering NL parsing, execution, safety, logging
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Task, Action, ApprovalRequest, ExecutionLog, Script
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to describe a task in natural language (e.g., "Organize my desktop files by date") so that an intelligent agent can safely execute it on my local machine while keeping me in control of every action.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have files scattered on my desktop, **When** I tell the agent "organize desktop files by date", **Then** the agent presents a clear action plan and asks for my approval before moving any files
2. **Given** the agent has proposed file organization actions, **When** I approve the plan, **Then** the agent executes the file moves and shows me a complete log of what was done
3. **Given** I want to launch a specific application, **When** I say "open my photo editor", **Then** the agent identifies the correct application and asks permission before launching it
4. **Given** the agent encounters an error during execution, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the agent stops immediately, notifies me of the issue, and provides options to rollback or continue
5. **Given** I want to review past automation, **When** I check the activity log, **Then** I can see all previous tasks, actions taken, and have options to undo recent changes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the natural language input is ambiguous or unclear?
- How does the system handle requests for actions that could be potentially harmful?
- What occurs when the user cancels an operation mid-execution?
- How does the system behave when required permissions are not available?
- What happens when the system cannot identify the requested application or file?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST parse natural language task descriptions and convert them into executable action plans
- **FR-002**: System MUST require explicit user approval before executing any system action or file operation  
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute tasks locally without any network or remote server communication
- **FR-004**: System MUST log all actions taken with timestamps, affected files/applications, and execution results
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time progress updates and allow users to cancel operations mid-execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST support common OS tasks including file operations, application launches, and basic UI interactions
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement safety checks to prevent potentially harmful system modifications
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide rollback capabilities for reversible operations like file moves and copies
- **FR-009**: System MUST work across Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain user privacy by keeping all data and processing local to the machine
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow developers to extend functionality through custom scripts and automation modules
- **FR-012**: System MUST complete typical automation tasks in under 10 seconds from approval to completion

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task**: Natural language description of desired automation, parsed intent, and generated action plan
- **Action**: Individual executable step within a task (file move, app launch, etc.) with safety classification
- **ApprovalRequest**: User consent mechanism with action details, risk assessment, and approval/denial status
- **ExecutionLog**: Audit trail containing timestamp, action taken, affected resources, and execution outcome
- **Script**: Extensible automation module that developers can create for custom task types
- **SafetyCheck**: Risk assessment component that evaluates proposed actions for potential system harm
